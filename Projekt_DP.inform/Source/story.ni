"Projekt iz kolegija Deklarativno programiranje" by Lucija Polak


The Starting Room is a room. "Your adventure begins here."

Ivan is a man in the Starting Room.
Petar is a man in the Starting Room.

A torch is a thing.
A gold coin is a thing.

The torch is carried by Ivan.
The gold coin is carried by Ivan.

The player is a person.

Character-chosen is a truth state that varies.
Character-chosen is false.

When play begins:
	now the player is in the Starting Room;
	say "Welcome to the game! It was created as a project for the Declarative Programming course. However, I hope you will still enjoy playing it.[paragraph break] ";
	say "Choose your character:[line break]";
	say "1 - Ivan (has a torch and one gold coin)[line break]";
	say "2 - Petar (has nothing)[paragraph break]";
	say "Type 1 or 2 to continue.";

Choosing is an action applying to one number.
Understand "[number]" as choosing.

Use undo prevention.

Carry out choosing:
	if Character-chosen is true:
		say "You have already chosen your character.";
	otherwise if the number understood is 1:
		now the player is Ivan;
		now Character-chosen is true;
		now Petar is off-stage;
		say "You have chosen Ivan. Good luck on your adventure!";
	otherwise if the number understood is 2:
		now the player is Petar;
		now Character-chosen is true;
		now Ivan is off-stage;
		say "You have chosen Petar. Good luck on your adventure!";
	otherwise:
		say "Invalid choice. Type 1 or 2.";

Instead of doing something other than choosing when Character-chosen is false:
	say "You must choose a character first. Type 1 or 2.";
